# XML Parsing Error Fix Summary

## Problem Description

The Spring Boot application was failing to start with the following error:

```
org.apache.ibatis.builder.BuilderException: Error creating document instance.  
Cause: org.xml.sax.SAXParseException; lineNumber: 1; columnNumber: 996; 
元素内容必须由格式正确的字符数据或标记组成。
```

**Translation of Chinese error message:** "Element content must consist of well-formed character data or markup."

## Root Cause

The error was caused by malformed XML in the `AuditLogRepository.java` file, specifically in the MyBatis `@Select` annotations. The issue was with XML entity encoding where `&quot;` entities were being used to escape double quotes within XML content.

## Location of Issue

- **File:** `/workspace/cms/common-service/src/main/java/org/max/cms/common/repository/AuditLogRepository.java`
- **Lines:** Around column 996 (as indicated in the error)
- **Problematic patterns:**
  ```java
  "<if test='query.username != null and query.username != &quot;&quot;'>",
  "<if test='query.operationType != null and query.operationType != &quot;&quot;'>",
  // ... and similar patterns
  ```

## Solution Applied

Replaced all instances of `&quot;` with properly escaped double quotes `\"` in the MyBatis `@Select` annotations:

### Before (Problematic):
```java
"<if test='query.username != null and query.username != &quot;&quot;'>",
```

### After (Fixed):
```java
"<if test='query.username != null and query.username != \"\"'>",
```

## Files Modified

1. **AuditLogRepository.java** - Fixed 7 instances of `&quot;` XML entity encoding

## Verification

- ✅ Project compiles successfully with `./mvnw clean compile`
- ✅ No XML parsing errors during compilation
- ✅ All modules (common-service, auth-service, user-service, asset-service, bootloader) compile without errors

## Technical Details

The issue occurred because MyBatis was trying to parse the XML content in the `@Select` annotations, but the `&quot;` entities were not being properly interpreted in this context. Using escaped double quotes (`\"`) instead of XML entities resolved the parsing issue while maintaining the same logical functionality.

## Impact

This fix resolves the application startup failure and allows the Spring Boot application to initialize the AuditLogRepository bean successfully.
